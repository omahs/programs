### Authenticate with an Advertiser DID

To create, deploy and update Ceramic Documents (aka Streams), you are required to create a DID.

To simply create a new DID and Seed Key:

```shell
usher advertiser auth
```

**Be sure to store your Seed Key in a safe place.**

### Create an Advertiser Profile/Doc

1. Use the `template` command to create a JSON template file that you can edit to your preference.
   ```shell
    usher advertiser template > advertiser.json
   ```
2. Once you've editted the `advertiser.json` file, create the Advertiser Doc:
   ```shell
    usher advertiser create --file ./advertiser.json --key auth_seed_key
   ```
3. To verify that you have created the doc, you can find the doc in your doc list:
   ```shell
    usher advertiser list
   ```

### Create a Campaign Details Doc

1. Use the `template` command to create a JSON template file that you can edit to your preference.
   ```shell
    usher campaign-details template > details.json
   ```
2. Once you've editted the `details.json` file, create the Campaign Details Doc:
   ```shell
    usher campaign-details create --file ./details.json --key auth_seed_key
   ```
3. To verify that you have created the doc, you can find the doc in your doc list:
   ```shell
    usher campaign-details list
   ```

### Create a Campaign

1. Use the `template` command to create a JSON template file that you can edit to your preference.
   ```shell
    usher campaign template > campaign.json
   ```
2. Take note of your Campaign Details and Adveriser Doc/Stream Identifiers.
   - These identifiers are relevant to the Ceramic Network.
   - `usher campaign-details list` and `usher advertiser list` can be used to fetch the relevant Ceramic Doc/Stream identifiers.
   - An example of an identifer is: `kjzl6cwe1jw149392kdn0ny2dgskjvwykev1b1jxxegvt83cjgqzbbkbkrk70w5`
3. Once you've editted the `campaign.json` file, create the Campaign:
   ```shell
    usher campaign create --file ./campaign.json --key auth_seed_key --wallet wallet_private_key_or_file --currency matic --advertiser advertiser_stream_id --details details_stream_id
   ```

This process will automatically index the Campagin on Usher after deploying the payload to the immutable Arweave storage environment.
