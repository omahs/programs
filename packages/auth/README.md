# `@usher.so/auth`

Usher Auth is a package that contains all of the authentication processes required to interface with Ceramic and with Usher's APIs.

## Features

### Wallet Abstraction

The Usher Auth module abstracts authentication with different wallets and authentication methods.
During authentication, a unique DID is produced deterministically dependent on the authentication method.
Authentication methods supported:

- Metamask
- Coinbase Wallet
- Wallet Connect
- Magic SDK
- Arweave (JWK) compatibile wallets

### Authentication

```javascript
import { AuthOptions, Connections } from "@usher.so/shared";

const AUTH_OPTIONS = AuthOptions({ environment: "production" });
const authInstance = new Authenticate(arweave, ethProvider, AUTH_OPTIONS);

await authInstance.withEthereum(
	wallet.accounts[0].address,
	Connections.METAMASK
);
const ethAuth = authInstance.getAuth(wallet.accounts[0].address);

// Print DID for this Auth
console.log(ethAuth.did.id);
```

### Auth Tokens for API usage

By generating a unique DID for each specific authentication, there is now a collection of authentications that represent the same user.
Each DID exposes a single interface for using cryptography for identifying the underlying authentication/user.
A token can be generated using this collection of authentications to unique indetify the user inside of an backend centralised API handler.
An API can then intelligently store each unqiue DID in relation to each other, ideally in a graph, to produce a profile of a user based on their authentication methods.

#### Generating an Auth Token

```javascript
import { AuthOptions, Connections } from "@usher.so/shared";

const AUTH_OPTIONS = AuthOptions({ environment: "production" });
const authInstance = new Authenticate(arweave, ethProvider, AUTH_OPTIONS);

await authInstance.withEthereum(
	wallet.accounts[0].address,
	Connections.METAMASK
);
await authInstance.withArweave(
	arweaveWalletAddress,
	Connections.ARCONNECT,
	arConnect // window.arweaveWallet
);

// Print DID for this Auth
const token = await authInstance.getAuthToken();
console.log(token);
```

#### Validating an Auth Token

The following example illustrates Auth Token validation inside of an Express.js Middleware/Handler.

```javascript
import { Base64 } from "js-base64";
import { DagJWS, DID } from "dids";
import { getResolver as getKeyResolver } from "key-did-resolver";

const verify = async (did: string, sig: DagJWS): Promise<boolean> => {
	const instance = new DID({
		resolver: {
			...getKeyResolver(),
		},
	});
	const result = await instance.verifyJWS(sig, { issuer: did });
	if (result.kid) {
		return true;
	}

	return false;
};

// --- Inside of Express.js handler
let payload;
try {
	payload = JSON.parse(Base64.decode(req.token));
} catch (e) {
	req.log.debug("Failed to parse token");
	return res.status(403).json({
		success: false,
	});
}

// Payload is an array of dids and their respective signature
try {
	const user = (
		await Promise.all(
			payload.map(
				async ([did, sig, wallet]: [string, DagJWS, string[] | undefined]) => {
					try {
						const instance = new DID({
							resolver: {
								...getKeyResolver(),
							},
						});
						const result = await instance.verifyJWS(sig, { issuer: did });
						const verified = !!result.kid;
						if (verified) {
							return {
								did,
								wallet: wallet
									? {
											chain: wallet[0],
											address: wallet[1],
									  }
									: null,
							};
						}
					} catch (e) {
						//* This will fail if the Signature Payload includes sepcial characters
						req.log.debug(
							{ error: e, did, sig, wallet },
							"Cannot verify JWS for DID"
						);
					}
					return null;
				}
			)
		)
	).filter((did) => typeof did !== null && !isEmpty(did));

	if (user.length === 0) {
		req.log.debug("No user loaded");
		return res.status(403).json({
			success: false,
		});
	}

	req.user = user;

	// Perform some logic on the user

	return next();
} catch (e) {
	req.log.error(e);
	return res.status(403).json({
		success: false,
	});
}
```
